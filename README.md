# # 🌊 Flood Prediction System using Machine Learning

## Overview

Floods are among the most devastating natural disasters, causing significant loss of life, property damage, and displacement of communities every year. Timely and accurate flood prediction plays a vital role in minimizing these impacts by enabling authorities to take preventive measures and issue early warnings.

This project presents a **Machine Learning-based Flood Prediction System** that predicts the likelihood of flood occurrence using historical environmental and meteorological data. The system compares multiple machine learning algorithms, including **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)**, and **XGBoost**, to identify the most effective prediction model.

The trained model is integrated into a **Flask web application**, allowing users to enter flood-related parameters and instantly receive a flood risk prediction through a user-friendly interface. The application is designed to be scalable and can be deployed on **IBM Cloud** for remote accessibility.

* `models/feature_names.pkl`

---

## Running the Application

Start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and visit:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Enter the required input parameters and click **Predict Flood Risk** to obtain the prediction.

---

## Application Workflow

1. User enters environmental parameters.
2. Flask receives the input data.
3. The trained machine learning model processes the input.
4. The application predicts the flood risk.
5. The result and confidence score are displayed to the user.

## Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1 – Early Flood Warning

A meteorologist enters current environmental conditions for a flood-prone district. The system predicts a high flood risk, enabling authorities to issue early evacuation warnings.

### Scenario 2 – Disaster Response

A disaster management officer monitors multiple regions by entering regional environmental data. The application helps prioritize emergency response and resource allocation.

### Scenario 3 – Model Validation

Government agencies evaluate the prediction model using historical flood records to assess its reliability before operational deployment.

* GIS and interactive map visualization
* SMS and email alert notifications
* Real-time rainfall monitoring
* IoT sensor integration
* IBM Cloud deployment
* Mobile application support
